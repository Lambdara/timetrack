# Timetrack

Timetrack is timetracking software that tries to follow the Unix philosophy.

The main goal of this program is to allow you to quickly and with little effort accomplish the following:
- Start tracking your time
- Stop tracking your time
- Manage your timetracking history using Git
- Summarize the amount of tracked time within a certain category
